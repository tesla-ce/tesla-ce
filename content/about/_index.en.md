TeSLA is an Adaptative trust based e-assessment system for learning that started as a European 
project in 2016 with 18 partners involved between quality assurance agencies, research centers and universities.

The European project finished in 2019, and from the beginning of 2020 the UOC has been working 
on a better tuning version of the TeSLA system, the TeSLA Community Edition, also known as TeSLA CE.

Tesla CE brings opportunities to universities and students that before had to go through 
face-to-face authentification and authorship processes at specific times.

It helps reducing cheating in e-learning using online and real time biometric instruments. 
But also, through plagiarism processes using other instruments in the background.

Tesla incorporates trust in the relationship between online students and education institutions.

The system also helps SEND students breaking the of traditional evaluation systems.
