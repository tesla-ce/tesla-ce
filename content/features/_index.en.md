### Instruments
TeSLA CE can use several tools and instruments for both, the identity and the originality verification processes. The systems includes some basic ones, but you can add your own instruments.

**Identity verification**: Based on images, audio or keyboard events captured while the learner is performing the activity.
1. Face recognition: Is the user the person in the picture or video?
   The instrument analyses facial expressions for facial detection and recognition. 
2. Voice recognition: Is the user who is talking?
   The instrument uses audio segments of about 10 seconds and apply speaker segmentation and cluster grouping for voice recognition. 
3. Keystroke dynamics: Is the user who is typing? 
   Keyboard events (key down/up) are captures and analyzed while the learnes is performing an activity, in order to 
   measure how the user writes in regards to pressure and time-based measuring. 

**Originality verification**: Based on submitted text documents that are processed offline and after the activity is finished.
1. Plagiarism tools: Are there similar documents to this one? 
   Analyses written material and dtects similarities among various written documents.
2. Forensic analysis: Is the user who wrote this text? 
   Determines the authorship verification and authorship attribution of written documents based 
   on the comparison of current documents with stored data.

### User Roles
In the TeSLA system we can differentiate roles for institution, instructor and learners, 
in addition to the common admin roles. All of them following a hierarchical system. 

Inside the institute role, we can grant different administrative permissions to its users based on their 
professional profile needs: legal information, data managemement, SEND categories and learners and statistical analysis.

### SEND Categories

Learners with Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND learners) may need some specific fine tuning of the system's options and instruments for identification process. 
TeSLA System contemplates this need.

* Define any SEND category.
* Enable options and disable instruments for each SEND categories.
* Apply a SEND category to specific learners.
